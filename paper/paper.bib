  abstract = {An outstanding challenge in the field of molecular biology has been to understand the process by which proteins fold into their characteristic three-dimensional structures. Here, we report the results of atomic-level molecular dynamics simulations, over periods ranging between 100 {$\mu$}s and 1 ms, that reveal a set of common principles underlying the folding of 12 structurally diverse proteins. In simulations conducted with a single physics-based energy function, the proteins, representing all three major structural classes, spontaneously and repeatedly fold to their experimentally determined native structures. Early in the folding process, the protein backbone adopts a nativelike topology while certain secondary structure elements and a small number of nonlocal contacts form. In most cases, folding follows a single dominant route in which elements of the native structure appear in an order highly correlated with their propensity to form in the unfolded state.}

  abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has swiftly forced a change in learning strategies across educational institutions, from extensively relying on in-person activities toward online teaching. It is particularly difficult to adapt courses that depend on physical equipment to be now carried out remotely. This is the case for bioinformatics, which typically requires dedicated computer classrooms, as the logistics of granting remote access to a workstation or relying on the computational resources of each student is not trivial. A possible workaround is using cloud server-based computing resources, such as Google Colaboratory, a free web browser application that allows the writing and execution of Python programming through Jupyter notebooks, integrating text, images, and code cells. Following a cloud-based approach, we migrated the practical activities of a course on molecular modeling and simulation into the Google Colaboratory environment resulting in 12 tutorials that introduce students to topics such as phylogenetic analysis, molecular modeling, molecular docking, several flavors of molecular dynamics, and coevolutionary analysis. Each of these notebooks includes a brief introduction to the topic, software installation, execution of the required tools, and analysis of results, with each step properly described. Using a Likert scale questionnaire, a pool of students positively evaluated these tutorials in terms of the time required for their completion, their ability to understand the content and exercises developed in each session, and the practical significance and impact that these computational tools have on scientific research. All tutorials are freely available at https://github.com/pb3lab/ibm3202.},

  abstract = {MDAnalysis is an object-oriented library for structural and temporal analysis of molecular dynamics (MD) simulation trajectories and individual protein structures. It is written in the Python language with some performance-critical code in C. It uses the powerful NumPy package to expose trajectory data as fast and efficient NumPy arrays. It has been tested on systems of millions of particles. Many common file formats of simulation packages including CHARMM, Gromacs, Amber, and NAMD and the Protein Data Bank format can be read and written. Atoms can be selected with a syntax similar to CHARMM's powerful selection commands. MDAnalysis enables both novice and experienced programmers to rapidly write their own analytical tools and access data stored in trajectories in an easily accessible manner that facilitates interactive explorative analysis. MDAnalysis has been tested on and works for most Unix-based platforms such as Linux and Mac OS X.
